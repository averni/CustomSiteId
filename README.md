# Matomo CustomSiteId Plugin

## Description

This plugin is a replacement I made for the protectTrackID plugin, that was used to obfuscate the siteId that seems to have discontinued support and broke in 4.0 matomo upgrade. This one allows the administrator to define a unique site id instead of generating a hash and prevents the original site from operation if the custom site id has been set.
